      This is the instruction about how to use the Field (path: src/components/UI/Field)

You can use Field component by writing such code:

<Field
   type="text"
   label="Email"
   labelColor="#0000ff"
   value={state.value}
   name="email"
   placeholder="Enter you email"
   isValid={state.isValid}
   isTouched={state.isTouched}
   errorMessage={state.errorMessage}
   leftIconClassNames="far fa-envelope"
   iconColor="green"
   onChange={onChangeHandler}/>


1. type - the type of input (email, password etc.)

2. label - the label of input

3. labelColor - the color of the label

4. value - here you save that text which user entered in the field

5. placeholder - the placeholder for your input

6. isValid - you can get the value of this param (true or false) from the state

7. isTouched - you need this param to understand if the input was touched. You can get the value of this param (true
or
false) from the state

8. errorMessage - you will save the error message for your input here

9. leftIconClassNames (rightIconClassNames) - this param helps you to paste the icon into the input on the left or right

side. I have used the Font Awesome as the API for icons (you can see its' CDN in public/index.html), so as the value of
this param
you have to
paste Font Awesome
classes of that icon which you want to use

10. iconColor - this param offers you to set the color for the icon. You need this param because the icons will have
different colors in
the different parts of the project

11. onChange - this param will describe the behavior of your input after the value was changed

12. name - here will be quite long description :)
  So, I think that the good practice would be to write onChange function for all inputs together rather than for
  everyone
   separately.
  In such case you need special unique name for every input. This is the reason why you need 'name' prop. You can even
  reuse your onChange function in other forms. You can write this function in the utils file.
   In such case your
   code looks like this:
   
     export const inputChangeHandler = (event, stateControls) => {
       const controls = {...stateControls}
       const {name} = event.target
       controls[name].value = event.target.value
       controls[name].touched = true
       controls[name].valid = checkValidity(event.target.value, controls[name].validation)

       return controls
     }

   So, in the form component you will need to write only this code:
     const onChangeHandler = (event) => {
       const controls = {...state.controls}
       inputChangeHandler(event, controls)

       setState({controls})
     }

     I think that the form component will look much easier by writing this code rather than:
     const onChangeHandler = (event) => {
       const controls = {...state.controls}
       controls.email.value = event.target.value
       controls.email.touched = true
       controls.email.valid = checkValidity(event.target.value, controls.email.validation)

       controls.password.value = event.target.value
       controls.password.touched = true
       controls.password.valid = checkValidity(event.target.value, controls.password.validation)

       controls.age.value = event.target.value
       controls.age.touched = true
       controls.age.valid = checkValidity(event.target.value, controls.age.validation)

       (...)

       setState({controls})
     }

P.S. Happy hacking!)
