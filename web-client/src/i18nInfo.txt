                This is instruction about how we will use react-intl(i18n)

This library will help us to make our website multilingual.

First of all, I created i18n directory (search in src folder). In this folder I created locales directory. Here I
created 3 directories which are named by shorted names of that languages which we will ue (if we want to add one more
language
we have to add one more directory and name it by shorted name of that language which we want to add). In every of these
folders I created index.js file where we have to export default object.

PLEASE, look on this 3 files and only after that read below!

IMPORTANT! If you were attentive you could notice that all 3 objects have the same keys. It's very important!!! It
doesn't matter how you name them, but they must be repeated in other objects!

Also you could notice that the values of objects' keys have the same meaning, but they are written on different
languages. It's how react-intl works. Instead of text we will paste keys from our objects. But it won't work if we just
paste keys instead of text. So, I will explain how to set react-intl in our code.

1. The main settings of react-intl you can see in App.js (path: src/components/App/App.js).
We can choose language which we want to use manually from App.js (code string - 31), but letter it will be chosen
conditionally.
2. We have to import FormattedMessage from react-intl before we use text.
(import {FormattedMessage} from 'react-intl')
3. Instead of text we create FormattedMessage component.
Like this:
    <FormattedMessage id="some_text"/>
Id - is one of that keys which we created in our translation objects.

For example:
    <h1>
        <FormattedMessage id="createAccount"/>
    </h1>

Instead of <FormattedMessage id="createAccount"/> we will get text on that language which we chose in App.js (code
string - 31).

Also we can use FormattedMessage conditionally (look on file SignInOrSignUpForm (path:
src/components/SignInOrSignUpForm)
 (Navlink component code line - 34)

 IMPORTANT! Typeof id has to be string. Anyone tells that id cannot be equal to variable or prop, but this
 variable or prop has to contain string.
 For example:
  Look on file Button (path: src/components/UI/Button/Button.js) (code line - 11) and on file Form (path:
  src/components/Form/Form.js) (code line - 65 and then 39. That strings that you can see on 40 and 42 code lines are
  keys from our translation objects).
4. Also we may have to paste text by using props in our component (for example: placeholder or label for input).
We canNOT do like this:
   NOT! <input type="text" placeholder={<FormattedMessage id="placeholder"/>} />
Instead of this we have to import injectIntl from react-intl.
(import {injectIntl} from 'react-intl')
Then we have to wrap our component by injectIntl, certainly before export (like hoc)
For example:
    export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(injectIntl(Form))
Then we can write this:
    placeholder={props.intl.formatMessage({id: "placeholder"})}
It will be correct.
You can also see how it works in Form component (path: src/components/Form/Form.js)

P.S. Happy hacking!)
